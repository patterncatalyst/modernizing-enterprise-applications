"""ch.12 figure: event-storming-legend -- the sticky-note color grammar from
"The grammar of a session" in `_docs/12-event-storming.md`, as a standalone
legend card, in the exact order the chapter introduces the colors: domain
events first (chaotic exploration), then commands, then actors, then
aggregates, then policies/reactions, then read models, then external
systems.

Each row names the real-world sticky color (quoted from the chapter) with a
small swatch chip, and maps it onto this project's diagram palette -- the
same box/sub/accent/user/ghost/kernel/ink mapping `event-storm-checkout.py`
already uses in its own legend note, formalized here as its own figure.
House style stays the primary visual language (white cards, green accent,
grey arrows); the swatches are small call-outs, not a repaint of the palette.

Examples quoted in each row are pulled verbatim from the chapter: OrderPlaced/
StockReserved/PaymentCaptured (events), Place Order/Reserve Stock/Capture
Payment (commands), Customer (actor), Order/InventoryItem (aggregates), the
two named policies (OrderPlaced->ReserveStock, StockReserved->CapturePayment),
Order Status (read model), and the card network / carrier dispatch API
(external systems).

Sourced from `_docs/12-event-storming.md` ("The grammar of a session").
