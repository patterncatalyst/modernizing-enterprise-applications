#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/retire-debezium.sh — retire (delete) the Debezium Postgres CDC
# connector and drop its replication slot + publication now that the
# monolith no longer writes `inventory_items` (r05/ch.19 step S11,
# _plans/iterations/inventory-plan.md), DRQ-040's slot-leak mitigation
# (H2) finally exercised end-to-end.
#
# CDC was transition-only infrastructure (S3): it initial-snapshot
# backfilled, then kept current, examples/04-inventory-service's owned
# database from the monolith's `public.inventory_items` table DURING the
# cutover window. Once the monolith's inventory write/reserve path is
# decommissioned (S11 — RemoteInventoryClient's gRPC Reserve against the
# inventory service's OWN database is the only writer left), the connector
# has nothing left to do; leaving its replication slot registered would
# retain WAL on mea-postgres indefinitely (disk-fill risk) for no benefit.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run. DELETE on a connector that is already gone
# returns 404, which this script treats as already-retired (not a failure);
# pg_drop_replication_slot/DROP PUBLICATION are guarded with existence
# checks so a second run is a no-op.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/retire-debezium.sh              # delete connector + drop slot/publication
#   scripts/retire-debezium.sh --status      # just report current state (no changes)
#
# Requires: curl, jq, podman (mea-postgres, mea-connect must be reachable).
# Does NOT touch the podman stack itself — no `compose down`, no `-v`, no
# removal of mea-postgres/mea-connect/mea-kafka. Only this one connector +
# its slot/publication are retired.
